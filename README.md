Some half-baked toys that show a bit of what I can do.

There are 5 independent pages you can check out. Seriously, if you don't even want to read code you can just scroll down to a header and click on it. They are linked to the page using rawgit, such that it will load normally in your browser. Right now the naming is a little messy, as they were not previously managed through version control. Also the working scripts are in-line in the HTML, if you can get past that. I intend to spruce things up soon.

##[Angular Tic Tac Toe](https://rawgit.com/jallows/toy-folio/master/angular-tic-tac-toe-2.html)
Not really tic-tac-toe yet, but click the squares and skim the code. The comments should be helpful. Uses some basic Angular I'd been picking up

##[Inline Block Toy](https://rawgit.com/jallows/toy-folio/master/inline-block-toy.html)
Playing with templates using an older simple library called ICanHaz.js. Push the buttons and cards in a trading card game (TCG) style will populate the area.

##[ICanHaz Oscillators](https://rawgit.com/jallows/toy-folio/master/icanhaz-oscillators.html)
Putting ICanHaz.js through some more work now, along with new code-generated audio functionality in JavaScript. This should work on most browsers, but I know for sure it works in Firefox & Chrome. Just click the add button to add a card representing a noisy oscillator, then click play to listen. You can change the sound's features while it is playing. As with all of these, if I were making it professionally, I would use an MVC framework such as Angular.

##[Math Challenge](https://rawgit.com/jallows/toy-folio/master/math-challenge-sketch2.html)
The most complete toy out of the bunch, this game is actually a little addictive for some people. It is an arithmetic time trial, demoing some more model-data-linked animations. Pauses the timer and hides the problem when the entry box loses focus.

##[Token Hunter](https://rawgit.com/jallows/toy-folio/master/token-hunter-sketch1.html)
A silly game premise about being a street urchin, hurting for coins to go play your favorite old arcade games. **Currently does nothing, but it is sort of pretty, and you can test run some of the functions from the developer console.**
